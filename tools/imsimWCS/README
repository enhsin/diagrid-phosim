This python script was written by Jim Pizagno at U.Washington.
This README file was written on 7-May-2009.

The code worked with python version:
Python 2.5.2

The code WCSsolution.py takes an image from the Image Simulation
output, which contains a linear TAN-SIP, and applies a polynomial
WCS solution. It uses the TAN-SIP convention, as described in 
document WCSdoc.pdf.

The code runs Source Extractor to find stars. Matches the 
positions predicted in the file "StarCatalogFormatTrim.dat" to 
the positions found by Source Extractor.  The code applies a 
sigma clipping routine, excluding all data points outside
of "sigmaclip".  It searches for stars that match within a 
magnitude given by "Dmag_limit" and within search radii 
given by "radius_limit" and "radius_min".
