Photon Simulator (phoSim)
------------------------------------------------------------

The photon simulator is a sophisticated set of codes that take astronomical catalogs and turn them into images using a photon Monte Carlo approach that encodes the physics of the atmosphere, telescope, and camera.    The documentation for phoSim is at https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/IS_phosim

Custom astronomical catalogs can be used as input to phoSim or, more commonly, the catalog framework which is described here: https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/IS_catsim is used together to produce high fidelity image simulations.

Both phoSim and the catalog framework code are written for the LSST project, the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration, and other projects by groups at Purdue University, UC Berkeley, Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory, and University of Washington.

PhoSim was created by John Peterson & Garrett Jernigan, and was subsequently developed by many collaborators.  Please reference Peterson et al. (2013), in preparation if you find this code useful.

INSTALLATION:
-------------

To install:

./configure

make


To test with a simulation of a single star:

./phosim examples/star -c examples/nobackground

------
USAGE:
------


Simple Usage:

./phosim  instance_catalog


Usage to change the physics:

./phosim  instance_catalog -c command_file
./phosim  instance_catalog --command=command_file


Usage if you want to move directories around:

./phosim  instance_catalog -o output_directory
./phosim  instance_catalog --output=output_directory


To list all the command line options:

./phosim -h
./phosim --help


To simulate images on specific sensors only:

./phosim  instance_catalog -s 'R22_S11'
./phosim  instance_catalog --sensor='R22_S11|R22_S12'

To run on condor:

./phosim  instance_catalog -g condor
./phosim  instance_catalog --grid=condor
